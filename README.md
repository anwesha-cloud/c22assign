# Gravity Boxes Simulation – 2020

> ⚠️ Note: This is an old JavaScript project using Matter.js, an early physics simulation project created to experiment with gravity, collisions, and interactive objects in a canvas environment.
> This project demonstrates basic physics using Matter.js. Users can spawn boxes by clicking, and these boxes interact with a static ground under adjustable gravity.

Features:

Dynamic Boxes: Click on the canvas to spawn boxes of random sizes.

Gravity Control: Adjustable gravity using a slider.

Collision Physics: Boxes collide and stack realistically on the static ground.

Visual Feedback: Shows gravity value and uses rotations for realistic box behaviour.
